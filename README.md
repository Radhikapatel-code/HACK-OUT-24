# HACK-OUT-24
this repo contains code files for our hackout project - 2024 which is based on the theme of "Agriculture Technology" and the problem system that we have taken is : Create a website designed specifically for farmers to efficiently manage and track their supplies stored in warehouses (or "godowns"). The platform will allow farmers to monitor inventory levels, including detailed tracking of various agricultural products and materials. If any surplus supplies are identified, farmers can list them for sale on the platform at competitive and fair market prices, connecting them with potential buyers. The website will provide an intuitive interface, enabling farmers to easily manage their stock, optimize storage, and ensure they maximize profitability by selling excess supplies at the right time.
